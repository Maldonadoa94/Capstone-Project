# **Project Proposal**

# **Goals**

1. The primary goal of this project will be to create a functional weather app.

2. The goal of the app is to allow a user to pull and request real time weather data from an API and save their search results to a profile.

3. The app should save different results based on the user, and will include authentication.

# **Stack Focus**

The focus of this project will be a front-end UI built using React.js..

# **Type**

The final project should be a functional website weather app.

# **Users**

Users of all types and all demographics should be allowed and able to use this app. It is a non-discriminatory app available for all that may have any needs of using a weather app.

# **Data**

There are numerous weather app data APIs out there to choose from. Whilst I havenâ€™t decided on which one in particular I will use, I know there are a plethora of ones to choose from. Some popular ones include: Tomorrow.io weather API, open-meteo, openweathermap.org, etc just to name a few. I need to do more research on these to ultimately decide which would be a best fit for this project.
