Starting with the proposals, my first idea is to make a clone of Facebook. But, instead of doing it as a normal Facebook, I would do a version for dogs. It could act as a social media site that uses an API to get data on dog breeds and uploaded to profiles that can be liked, shared, etc, and it can store user authentication and data on a profile.There are numerous APIs out there for retrieving data on dogs.

My second idea is similar to the first but instead of a site to store dogs, it would be a site to share and communicate with inspirational quotes. There are numerous APIs online that I can pull from, and also work on similar attributes as the first idea such as authentication, databases, profiles, etc.

The final idea is to make a weather app. There are plenty of weather app APIs I can use for a user to retrieve weather data for any given location, and store a history of searches for any given user that signs in to use the app. Any user should be able to pull any current weather data for not only their location, but any location they are curious about. This is the project I am most likely to work on.

Of course, these are subject to change as time goes on.
